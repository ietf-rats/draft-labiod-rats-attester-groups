                 Attester Groups for Remote Attestation
                draft-labiod-rats-attester-groups-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes an extension to the Remote Attestation
   Procedures architecture by introducing the concept of Attester
   Groups.  This extension aims to reduce computational and
   communication overhead by enabling collective Evidence appraisal of
   high number of homogeneous devices with similar characteristics,
   thereby improving the scalability of attestation processes.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC9334] defines Attesters as entities comprising at least one
   Attesting Environment and one Target Environment co-located in one
   entity.  It also presents different ways to compose the Attesting and
   Target Environemtns, such as Composite Devices and Layered Attesters.
   Layed Attester reflects a cascade of staged Environments.  It is more
   related to one device with different layers and there is a
   relationship between them.  However, mechanisms for efficiently
   managing multiple, independent Attesters are missing.  Assessing the
   trustworthiness of large numbers of independent devices individually
   can result in high conveyance and processing overhead.  This comes
   into effect particularly when these devices share identical hardware
   or firmware components, which can lead to redundancy between all
   individual remote attestation procedures.  One example would be a
   smart factory scenario where numerous sensors of the same model
   monitor different parts of the manufacturing process.  These sensors
   share identical hardware and firmware configurations.  This document
   proposes a model by which these separate sensors devices can be
   grouped into a single Attester Group and a shared remote attestation
   procedure can appraise their authenticity collectively rather than
   individually.  Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) [I-D.ietf-rats-daa]
   has a similar concept of using one unique ID for one group of
   Attesters, but its goal is to mitigate the issue of uniquely
   (re-)identifiable Attesting Environments, while scalability is the
   major concern in this document.

2.   Terminology

   The following terms are imported from [RFC9334]: Attester, Composite
   Device, Evidence, Layered Attester, Verifier.

   Newly defined terms for this document:

   Attester Group:  A role performed by a group of Attesters whose
      Evidence must be appraised in order to infer the extent to which
      the individual Attesters comprising the group are considered
      trustworthy.

   group-id:  A new Attester Identity type (see Section 2.2.1. of
      [I-D.ietf-rats-ar4si]).  It is a unique identifier assigned to
      each Attester Group, allowing the group to dynamically adjust its
      membership without redefining its fundamental identity.

2.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Attester Group and Comparison to Composite Devices

   We should be able to leverage the similarities between attesters to
   avoid redundant attestations.  An Attester Group is by definition a
   dynamic entity.  Attesters can join or leave the group, in contrast
   to Composite Devices that have a static composition with a pre-
   defined set of Attesting Environments and fixed parameters.  The
   dynamic nature of an Attester Group allows for the flexibility to
   tailor group parameters.  This kind of flexibility facilitates the
   implementation of various group attestation schemes that can optimize
   the resources required to conduct remote attestation procedures for
   large device groups.  A composite device is an entity composed of
   multiple sub entities.  Each sub entity is an Attester.  In a
   composite device we can have multiple Attesters with a Lead Attester.
   The Attesters are appraised via the main Lead Attester's help.  The
   lead Attester generates Evidence about the layout of the whole
   composite device, while sub-Attesters generate Evidence about their
   respective (sub-)modules.  Composite device model is not enough
   flexible to represent our definition of Attester Group where we do
   need a leader attester nor a composition of evidences of the
   attesters.

   The table below summarizes the key differences between the Group
   Attester concept and the Composite Device concept.

     +===================================+==========================+
     | Composite Device                  | Attester Group           |
     +===================================+==========================+
     | Lead Attester                     | No Lead Attester         |
     +-----------------------------------+--------------------------+
     | The Composite Device is           | The Attester Group is    |
     | identifiable by the Lead Attester | identifiable by a group- |
     |                                   | id a unique identifier   |
     +-----------------------------------+--------------------------+
     | Composition of Evidence of sub-   | No composition           |

     +-----------------------------------+--------------------------+

4.  Attester Group Extension

   In Section 3 (Architectural Overview) of [RFC9334]: we could add a
   subsection 3.4 titled "Attester Groups".  In addidion, Section 2.2
   (Non-repudiable Identitythe) of the draft [I-D.ietf-rats-ar4si], we
   could add an Identity Type "group-id" (i.e add another row in the
   Table 1 in [I-D.ietf-rats-ar4si]).

5.  Use Case Scenarios with a large scale network

   In this section, we provide three examples of applications where all
   devices are homogeneous with similar characteristics.

   Use Case 1: Remote maintenance in the aerospace domain

   Context: EU ASSURED H2020 Project.  Once an aircraft lands, there is
   the need for the physical presence of an engineer to go and connect
   to the "head unit" (in the cockpit) for extracting log data so as to
   check whether something needs to be checked/maintained.  We need
   attestation of all core PLCs and embedded systems responsible for the
   core functionalities of the aircraft.  All attestation reports are
   remotely sent (in a secure manner) to the control station once
   landed.  We can group the attested elements into different Attester
   Groups.

   Approach: We can consider an Attester Group of 1000 aircrafts (same
   manufacturing brand)

   Use Case 2: Automotive domain, a Vehicle with embedded Electronic
   Control Units (ECUs)

   Context: CONNECT EU H2020 project.  The automotive industry is moving
   to a more hierarchical in-vehicle architecture where ECUs are
   monitored by Zonal Controllers and these in turn communicate with the
   Vehicle Computer.  This is, for instance, how kinematic data are
   extracted from the sensors all the way up to the vehicle computer to
   be encoded into a V2X message.  This data need to be associated with
   Evidence on the integrity of the sensor as a data source and this is
   where group attestation is an interesting capability.  The Attester
   Group can be formed for hierarchical-based attestation, like Attester
   Group of all in-vehicle ECUs or attested group of vehicles within an
   intersection.

   Approach: we can consider an Attester Group of a fleet of 70000
   vehicles (same brand).  We can also consider an Attester Group of
   similar ECUs.

   Use Case 3: AI computing cluster

   Context: An AI computing cluster is a composite computing environment
   composed of a group of computing nodes/chips on which one ore more
   computing tasks are executed.  A user or an application/large model
   provider needs to verify the integrity of the collected measurement/
   evidence information from the composite computing environment.

   Challenge: The cluster may contain heterogeneous trusted roots, and
   the composition may be dynamically updated.  Repeated attestation is
   not efficient if done without context and can be very expensive.

   Approach: We can consider a large group of attesters or a set of
   group attesters.  An attester group that maps to the nodes of a
   cluster that executes a specific task may be dynamically created or
   dissolved according to the requirements of the computing task.  One
   ore more remote attestation server/verifier appraise collected
   evidence/measurements for the entire composite computing environment.
   The intend of remote group attestation is to hide the complexity of
   that back-end computing node interaction from customers (the Relying
   Parties), while still being able to assess its trustworthiness.
   Generally, a master node in the group is responsible for
   communicating with the Verifiers (or indirectly with the customer if
   they triggered remote attestation as a Relying Party), responding to
   the remote attestation challenge request of the client, collecting
   evidence claims of all group nodes as a whole, and sending the
   evidence to the verifier for appraisal.

   When all computing nodes/chips in a computing attester group are
   provided by the same vendor or deployed by the same cloud vendor, a
   unified and centralized dedicated hardware root of trust can be
   deployed (e.g., hardware security chip, centralized hardware DIE, or
   BMC) to offload important security functions (secure storage,
   security monitoring, etc.) to this independent module.  The trusted
   boot and other related measurement information of the group are
   securely stored on the unified root of trust.  During the remote
   attestation process, the master node of the group collects
   measurement from this module, and the unified root of trust signs all
   the measurement.  If a single root of trust manages multiple chips, a
   single point of failure (such as malicious intrusion and system
   breakdown) of the root of trust affects the security of the entire
   attester group managed by the root of trust.  The unified trusted
   root should support distributed and pooled design.  Multiple roots of
   trust may work together to enhance overall security and reliability.

   In heterogeneous interconnection scenarios where all computing nodes
   and chips in a computing cluster are provided by different vendors, a
   unified root of trust may not be deployed.  During the group remote
   attestation process, the master node needs to communicate with each
   group node to collect its own measurement information.  The
   information is signed by the private key of each node.  The master
   node collects the information, packs the information, and sends it to
   the remote attestation server for appraisal.  The dynamicity of the
   computing attested group is refected through the following aspects: -
   the creation and cancellation of a group is dynamically triggered by
   the life cycle management of computing tasks.  The member scale,
   type, and quantity of measurement information to be collected are
   dynamically generated and dynamically change.  Before performing
   remote attestation, customers are required to dynamically obtain all
   related information through the management system interface.  Based
   on this, a template-based remote attestation request message is
   defined and sent to the master node. - According to the dynamic
   requirements of computing task functions, performance, and to the
   trustworthy state changes of member nodes, the overall state of the
   group (including the state change of each existing node, the exit of
   the existing node from the group, the addition of a new node to the
   group, the replacement of the existing node by the new node, etc.) is
   dynamic.  These dynamic changes lead to the need for real-time
   dynamic update of group remote attestation.  In this case,
   incremental update should be supported.  That is, updating the
   measurement value of a single node does not cause the measurement of
   all or other nodes to be recollected and calculated, resulting in the
   increased communication and computing load.  Especially when the
   group size is large, these unnecessary load needs to be optimized.
   In the process of group remote attestation, the client can not only
   integrate the communication key negotiation with the master node, but
   also support the communication key negotiation with other nodes in
   the group.  Therefore, the key negotiation material is required to be
   generated by the client and different nodes separately.  In addition,
   the exchange is completed in the request message and result return
   message of the remote attestation, and the exchange is transmitted to
   the two ends of each communication session, so that the client and
   each group node that need to communicate can calculate the session
   key for mutual communication, so as to implement the subsequent
   establishment of the security channel.
