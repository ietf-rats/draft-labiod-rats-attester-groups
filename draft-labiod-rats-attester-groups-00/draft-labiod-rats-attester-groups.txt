                 Attester Groups for Remote Attestation
                draft-labiod-rats-attester-groups-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes an extension to the Remote Attestation
   Procedures architecture as defined in [RFC9334] by introducing the
   concept of Attester Groups.  This extension aims to reduce
   computational and communication overhead by enabling collective
   attestation of devices with similar characteristics, thereby
   improving the scalability of attestation processes.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC9334] defines Attesters as entities comprising at least one
   Attesting Environment and one Target Environment.  It also introduces
   configurations, such as Composite Devices and Layered Attesters.
   However, mechanisms for efficiently managing multiple, independent
   Attesters are missing.  Assessing the trustworthiness of large
   numbers of independent devices individually can result in high
   conveyance and processing overhead.  This comes into effect
   particularly when these devices share identical hardware or firmware
   components, which can lead to redundancy between all individual
   remote attestation procedures.  One example would be a smart factory
   scenario where numerous sensors of the same model monitor different
   parts of the manufacturing process.  These sensors share identical
   hardware and firmware configurations.  This document proposes a model
   by which these separate sensors devices can be grouped into a single
   Attester Group and a shared remote attestation procedure can appraise
   their authenticity collectively rather than individually.  Direct
   Anonymous Attestation (DAA) [I-D.ietf-rats-daa] has a similar concept
   of using one unique ID for one group of Attesters, but its goal is to
   mitigate the issue of uniquely (re-)identifiable Attesting
   Environments, while scalability is the major concern in this
   document.

2.   Terminology

   The following terms are imported from [RFC9334]: Attester, Composite
   Device, Evidence, Layered Attester, Verifier.

   Newly defined terms for this document:

   Attester Group:  A role performed by a group of Attesters whose
      Evidence must be appraised in order to infer the extent to which
      the individual Attesters comprising the group are considered
      trustworthy.

   group-id:  A new Attester Identity type (see Section 2.2.1. of
      [I-D.ietf-rats-ar4si]).  It is a unique identifier assigned to
      each Attester Group, allowing the group to dynamically adjust its
      membership without redefining its fundamental identity.

2.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Attester Group and Comparison to Composite Devices

   An Attester Group is inherently a dynamic entity.  Attesters can join
   or leave the group, in contrast to Composite Devices that have a
   static composition with a pre-defined set of Attesting Environments
   and fixed parameters.  The dynamic nature of an Attester Group allows
   for the flexibility to tailor group parameters, such as the number of
   Lead Attesters in the group (if any), the range of devices included
   in the group, and which or how much Evidence is expected to be
   produced by each groups.  This kind of flexibility facilitates the
   implementation of various group aggregation schemes that can optimize
   the resources required to conduct remote attestation procedures for
   large device groups.  The table below summarizes the key differences
   between the Group Attester concept and the Composite Device concept.

      +=============+===================+==========================+
      | Feature     | Composite Device  | Attester Group           |
      +=============+===================+==========================+
      | Evidence    | One Evidence per  | More granular, e.g., one |
      | Submission  | composite device  | Evidence per two members |
      +-------------+-------------------+--------------------------+
      | Lead        | One Lead Attester | Multiple or no lead      |
      | Attester    | communicates with | Attesters (i.e.,         |
      |             | Verifier          | distributed collection)  |
      +-------------+-------------------+--------------------------+
      | Identity    | Identifiably by   | Identified by unique     |
      |             | its lead Attester | group-id, independent of |
      |             |                   | lead Attester            |
      +-------------+-------------------+--------------------------+
      | Flexibility | Static, with pre- | Dynamic, where members   |
      | & Dynamics  | defined members   | can join or leave        |
      |             | and roles         |                          |
      +-------------+-------------------+--------------------------+
